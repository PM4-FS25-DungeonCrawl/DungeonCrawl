Bugfixes and TODOs DungeonCrawl

Bugfixes:
[] fix "press any key to continue"
[] fix weird flickering (probably render problem), especially in stat mode
[] fix snprintf bugs
[] input handling problems:
    - no multithreading if possible (performance is not an issue at all here)
    - actually use the input handler instead of calling the notcurses methods directly
    - input delay in some instances (see todo "screen update wait for input bug")
[] screen update wait for input bug: (display not updated after first keyboard input, only after next one)
    - return from menu
    - return from inventory
    - return from stats (screen clears immediately, but map shows only after input)
    - return from item submenu to inventory
    - return from loot menu to map

TODO:
[] implement loading screens (transition screens)
[] properly handle initialization and shutdown of all modules (currently not the case)
[] implement media output functionality (working example in fuckery branch)
[] color nc channels for everything
[] put stats and player image display thingy next to map in map mode
[] display HP and MP in Map Mode and make visuals nicer in general
