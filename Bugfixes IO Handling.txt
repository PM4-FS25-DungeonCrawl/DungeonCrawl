Bugfixes and TODOs DungeonCrawl

Bugfixes:
[] fix weird flickering (probably render problem), especially in stat mode
[] input handling problems:
    - no multithreading if possible (performance is not an issue at all here)
    - actually use the input handler instead of calling the notcurses methods directly

TODO:
[] implement media output functionality (working example in fuckery branch)
[] write doc for all io functions
